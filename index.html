    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Clouds are visible masses of water vapor or ice crystals 
        suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. They are an essential 
        part of the Earth's water cycle and play a crucial role in weather
         patterns. Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing
          the water vapor in the air to condense into tiny water droplets or
           ice crystals. These droplets or crystals gather together to form
            visible cloud formations.	</p>
            <p>Clouds come in various shapes, sizes, and altitudes, and they can be 
                classified into different types based on their appearance and altitude. The most 
                common cloud types include cumulus clouds, which are fluffy and often resemble cotton balls; 
                stratus clouds, which form in layers and appear as a uniform gray sheet covering the sky; and 
                cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy and can form at high altitudes.</p>

                <p> Clouds can have different colors depending on the position of the sun and the presence 
                    of other atmospheric conditions. They can be white, gray, or even appear to have shades 
                    of orange or pink during sunrise or sunset.</p>
                
                    <p>  Clouds have a significant impact on weather and climate. They reflect sunlight 
                        back into space, which helps cool the Earth's surface. They also absorb and emit heat, 
                        contributing to the overall energy balance of the planet. Furthermore, clouds play a crucial 
                        role in the water cycle by releasing precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail.</p>
                        <p>   Scientists study clouds to better understand weather patterns, climate change, and the 
                            Earth's energy balance. Satellites, weather radars, and ground-based observations are used 
                            to monitor and study cloud formations, allowing meteorologists to make more accurate weather 
                            forecasts and climate projections.</p>

    <h1>three main cloud types</h1>
    
       <h2>The three main cloud types are cumulus clouds, stratus clouds, 
        and cirrus clouds. These cloud types are classified based on their appearance and altitude in the atmosphere.</h2>
    <p>Cumulus Clouds: Cumulus clouds are often described as fluffy, cauliflower-like 
        clouds with a flat base and a dome-shaped top. They are typically associated with fair
         weather conditions. Cumulus clouds form in the lower to middle levels of the atmosphere 
         and are composed of water droplets. They can vary in size from small, individual clouds
          to larger, towering formations called cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with thunderstorms. <img src="/pic/culumus.jpeg"> </p>
    <br>
    <p>Stratus Clouds: Stratus clouds are low-level clouds that form in flat, uniform layers
         covering the sky. They have a gray or white appearance and often bring overcast conditions.
          Stratus clouds are composed of water droplets and can sometimes be thick enough to produce
           drizzle or light rain. They are typically found below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and can
            extend upward into higher altitudes.<img src="/pic/Stratus Clouds.jpeg"> </p>
    <br>
    <p>Cirrus Clouds: Cirrus clouds are high-level clouds that form at altitudes above 20,000 feet
         (6,000 meters). They have a thin and wispy appearance, resembling delicate white or light
          gray filaments. Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals and are often associated with fair weather 
          conditions. They can indicate the approach of a warm front or the change in weather patterns. <img src="/pic/wallpaperflare.com_wallpaper (1).jpg" ></p>
    <br>
        <p>Altocumulus: Altocumulus clouds are the most common clouds in the middle atmosphere.
             You'll recognize them as white or gray patches that dot the sky in large, rounded masses
              or clouds that are aligned in parallel bands. They look like the wool of sheep 
            or scales of mackerel fish—hence their nicknames "sheep backs" and "mackerel skies." <img src="/cloudpic/Altocumulus.jpg" ></p>
    <br>
        <p>Nimbostratus:Nimbostratus clouds are dark, grey, featureless layers of cloud, thick enough to 
            block out the Sun and produce persistent rain. Height of base: 2,000 - 10,000 ft. Shape: Bands or areas of 
            individual cells. Latin: nimbus - rainy cloud; stratus - flattened or spread out. Precipitation: Continuous rain or snow likely.<img src="/cloudpic/Nimbostratus.jpg" ></p>
    <br>
        <p>Altostratus: Altocumulus clouds are thin, mid-altitude clouds that form roughly 6,000 to 20,000 
            feet above ground level. The name comes from the Latin word alto, which means "high" and the Latin word cumulus
             which means "a heap or pile." Altocumulus has several sub-species, including altocumulus castellanus, 
             altocumulus floccus, altocumulus lenticularis, altocumulus stratiformis, and altocumulus volutus. Altocumulus 
             clouds do not generally produce precipitation however they do signify atmospheric instability and they are one 
             of three types of "warning clouds" that are used to predict thunderstorms hours ahead of time.<img src="/cloudpic/Altostratus.jpg" >

        </p>
    <br>
        <p>Stratocumulus: clouds are low-level clumps or patches of cloud varying in colour
             from bright white to dark grey. They are the most common clouds on earth recognised by their well-defined bases,
              with some parts often darker than others.They usually have gaps between them, but they can also be joined together.<img src="/cloudpic/Stratocumulus.jpg" ></p>
    <br>
        <p>Cirrocumulus:What are cirrocumulus clouds? Cirrocumulus clouds are <u>made up of lots of small white clouds called 
            cloudlets, which are usually grouped together at high levels.</u> Composed almost entirely from ice crystals,
             the little cloudlets are regularly spaced, often arranged as ripples in the sky.<img src="/cloudpic/cirrocumulus-clouds.jpg" ></p>
    <br>
        <p>Cirrostratus: are <u>transparent high clouds, which cover large areas of the sky.</u>
             They sometimes produce white or coloured rings, spots or arcs of light around the Sun or Moon, 
             that are known as halo phenomena. Sometimes they are so thin that the halo is the only indication that a cirrostratus cloud is in the sky.<img src="/cloudpic/cirrostratus.jpg" ></p>
    <br> 
        <p>Cumulonimbus:  clouds are <u>menacing looking multi-level clouds, extending high into the sky in 
            towers or plumes.</u> More commonly known as thunderclouds, cumulonimbus is the only cloud type that can produce
             hail, thunder and lightning.<img src="/cloudpic/cumulonimbuss.jpg" ></p>
