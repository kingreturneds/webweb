    <br>    
    <p>Clouds are visible masses of water vapor or ice crystals 
        suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. They are an essential 
        part of the Earth's water cycle and play a crucial role in weather
         patterns. Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing
          the water vapor in the air to condense into tiny water droplets or
           ice crystals. These droplets or crystals gather together to form
            visible cloud formations.	</p>
            <p>Clouds come in various shapes, sizes, and altitudes, and they can be classified into different types based on their appearance and altitude. The most common cloud types include cumulus clouds, which are fluffy and often resemble cotton balls; stratus clouds, which form in layers and appear as a uniform gray sheet covering the sky; and cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy and can form at high altitudes.</p>

                <p> Clouds can have different colors depending on the position of the sun and the presence of other atmospheric conditions. They can be white, gray, or even appear to have shades of orange or pink during sunrise or sunset.</p>
                
                    <p>  Clouds have a significant impact on weather and climate. They reflect sunlight back into space, which helps cool the Earth's surface. They also absorb and emit heat, contributing to the overall energy balance of the planet. Furthermore, clouds play a crucial role in the water cycle by releasing precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail.</p>
                
                    <p>   Scientists study clouds to better understand weather patterns, climate change, and the Earth's energy balance. Satellites, weather radars, and ground-based observations are used to monitor and study cloud formations, allowing meteorologists to make more accurate weather forecasts and climate projections.</p>

    <h1>three main cloud types</h1>
    
       <h2>The three main cloud types are cumulus clouds, stratus clouds, and cirrus clouds. These cloud types are classified based on their appearance and altitude in the atmosphere.</h2>
    <p>Cumulus Clouds: Cumulus clouds are often described as fluffy, cauliflower-like clouds with a flat base and a dome-shaped top. They are typically associated with fair weather conditions. Cumulus clouds form in the lower to middle levels of the atmosphere and are composed of water droplets. They can vary in size from small, individual clouds to larger, towering formations called cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with thunderstorms. <img src="/pic/culumus.jpeg"> </p>
    <br>
    <p>Stratus Clouds: Stratus clouds are low-level clouds that form in flat, uniform layers covering the sky. They have a gray or white appearance and often bring overcast conditions. Stratus clouds are composed of water droplets and can sometimes be thick enough to produce drizzle or light rain. They are typically found below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and can extend upward into higher altitudes.<img src="/pic/Stratus Clouds.jpeg"> </p>
    <br>
    <p>Cirrus Clouds: Cirrus clouds are high-level clouds that form at altitudes above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). They have a thin and wispy appearance, resembling delicate white or light gray filaments. Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals and are often associated with fair weather conditions. They can indicate the approach of a warm front or the change in weather patterns. <img src="/pic/wallpaperflare.com_wallpaper (1).jpg" ></p>
