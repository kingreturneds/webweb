    <div>The 10 Main Types of Clouds </div>
    <br>    
    <p>Are you interested in the sky's contents or do you need to know the various sorts of clouds for school? All clouds may initially appear to be very similar, but with a little bit of information and practise, you can quickly figure out which type of cloud you are looking at.
        We outline every step in this manual that will enable you to recognise clouds. We'll go over the ten primary kinds of clouds and provide you with the knowledge you need to recognise each one, including the names of the clouds, their shapes, heights in the sky, colours, and the types of weather you can anticipate from them.
